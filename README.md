## covertinator - simple converter script.

#### Introduction

Ever find your self fiddling around with Google in order to convert something? Why should we do this?! We have perfectly capable computers in front of us, and so I started making this script to use the computer in front of me instead of ask another down a copper (or optic) cable.

Also I wanted to learn a bit about Perl.

#### Plans

I want to add as much math(s) into this script as possible and maybe have sister script written in bash.

Currently planned conversion:

 - Time.
 - More distances (imperial, also from and to metric).
 - Data sizes.
